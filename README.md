This is a simple version of the Pong game written in JS using the P5.js library.
This can be run by starting a local server and navigating to the p5 folder.

todo:
1. Add in obstacles for the ball to hit that appear randomly.
2. Think of some other ideas for cool things to happen in the game

Started on adding in the obstacles however this will be more difficult due to collisions with the top and the bottom of paddle.
